## Inspiration
Both Soham and I are part of the **Global Ecology** program. We've always been interested in the environment, so we decided to create a bot that would tell us about the atmospheric conditions outside. In the morning, most people don't want to think about what to wear for the day, so this bot uses forecast information in order to develop a list of clothes that one could comfortably wear throughout the day.

## What it does
We have multiple commands including **air quality**, **weather**, and even a command that tells specifically **what to wear**. The air quality command allows users to see the exact air quality rating with a visual guide. It also gives the user exact recommendations on how they should stay safe throughout the day. Our weather command gives insight on what the temperature currently 


## How we built it
Over the course of a day, Soham and I used **Discord.js** and **Axios** to access the **MapQuest API** and the **Breezeometer API**. We started with **Repl.it** and moved to **Live share with VS Code**.

## Challenges we ran into
We first started with Repl.it and Python and that caused us to code **without autocompleting or autoformatting**. This ruined our productivity as we spent half the time adding tabs. Additionally, our bot **stopped working for no apparent**, yet after we moved to VSCode on our local machines, it miraculously started working again. We also had **limited time** due to our personal lives, so we had to **collaborate** and work on the project together.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're really proud of how we **navigated the confusing and complex APIs of Breezeometer and MapQuest** as we never really worked with APIs before. We also **organized our code very well** with different folders for commands and functions. We were also not familiar with the new Discord.js API.

## What we learned
We learned how to use **REST APIs** in order to enrich our code and provide data for our commands. We also learned how to send **HTTP requests** with Axios and format the response. Soham 

## What's next for Breathe
If given more time, we would **integrate air quality readings into outfit suggestions** and also **give Breathe a fashion sense üòÅ**.
